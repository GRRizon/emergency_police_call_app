# Copilot Instructions — emergency_police_call_app

This file contains concise, actionable guidance for AI coding agents making changes in this repository. Focus on discoverable, project-specific patterns and workflows.

**Project Overview**
- **Type:** Flutter multi-platform app (mobile + web + desktop) — top-level platform folders: `android/`, `ios/`, `windows/`, `linux/`, `macos/`.
- **Entry point:** `lib/main.dart` (root `MyApp` widget, sample `MyHomePage` stateful widget).
- **Key config:** `pubspec.yaml` (dependencies, Flutter assets), `analysis_options.yaml` (lint rules).

**Build / Run / Test (use these exact commands)**
- **Get deps:** `flutter pub get`
- **Run locally (hot reload):** `flutter run` (or from IDE). On Windows, for Android-specific Gradle tasks use `.
\android\gradlew.bat` from the repository root.
- **Run tests:** `flutter test` (there is a starter `test/widget_test.dart`).
- **Static analysis:** `flutter analyze` (project uses `flutter_lints` and `analysis_options.yaml`).
- **Format:** `dart format .` or `flutter format .`

**Code & Architecture Notes**
- UI code lives under `lib/`. `main.dart` follows the typical pattern: stateless root widget + stateful page using `setState` for local state.
- When adding features, prefer creating new Dart files under `lib/` and import from `main.dart` or a new `lib/app.dart` entry.
- Use `setState` for simple local state (as shown in `lib/main.dart`); for cross-widget/state management no framework is present—add a package and wire it in `pubspec.yaml` if needed.

**Project-specific conventions**
- **Publishing:** `pubspec.yaml` contains `publish_to: 'none'` — this repo is not configured for pub.dev publishing.
- **Assets:** No assets declared in `pubspec.yaml`; to add assets update `flutter.assets` in `pubspec.yaml` and run `flutter pub get`.
- **Lints:** This repo uses `flutter_lints`—follow `analysis_options.yaml` rules when changing code.

**Integration points & platform specifics**
- iOS: `ios/Runner/` (Info.plist, asset catalogs). Android: `android/app/` (Kotlin/Gradle `.kts` files). Windows/macOS/linux folders contain platform runner code and generated plugin registrants.
- Many platform files are generated by Flutter; avoid manual edits to generated registrant files unless necessary.

**How to modify safely (examples)**
- Add a package: update `pubspec.yaml` → run `flutter pub get` → import in `lib/`.
- UI change example: to add a screen, create `lib/screens/new_screen.dart`, export it from `lib/main.dart` or a router file, and update `MaterialApp.home`.
- Build Android release on Windows: open PowerShell in repo root and run `.
\android\gradlew.bat assembleRelease` (or use `flutter build apk`).

**Testing and verification**
- After changes run `flutter analyze`, `dart format .`, then `flutter test`.
- For UI changes prefer manual smoke testing via `flutter run` with hot reload to verify visual behavior.

**When in doubt / missing info**
- This repo contains no CI configuration or secrets management files — ask the maintainer for CI steps, signing keys, or any private services (e.g., Firebase credentials) before adding integrations.
- If you modify platform-specific configuration (Android/iOS), list required manual steps in the PR description.

If anything above is unclear or you need repository-specific CI/secret details, please ask — I can iterate the instructions.
